# User Directory

## Description
This User Directory is an employee directory that uses React. An employer can view their entire employee directory at once, having quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It is particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* NodeJS
* Express
* React
* Create React App
* Components
* JSX
* JSX variables
* Props

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The user is able to sort the table by at least one category as well as filter the users by at least one property.
